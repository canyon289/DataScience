This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Downloading file for analysis
```{r DownloadFiles, eval = False}
download.file(url = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2",
              destfile = "storm.bz2")
```

Load file into storm dataframe
```{r LoadData}
storm = read.csv(bzfile("storm.bz2"))
```

Summarize data by event type and fatality

```{r InitialSummary}
library(plyr)
ef = ddply(storms, .(EVTYPE), summarise, fatalities = sum(FATALITIES), injuries = sum(INJURIES), affected = (sum(FATALITIES,INJURIES)))
ef = eventfatality[order(eventfatality$fatalities, decreasing = TRUE),]
```
Sum Injuries and Fatalities to get total count of affected people
```{r}
eventfatality = ddply(eventfatality, .(EVTYPE), transform, affected = (fatalities + injuries))
```
